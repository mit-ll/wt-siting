Supplementary materials for Radar-Aware Wind Turbine Siting paper by Brigada and
Ryvkina, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 2021.

Includes core wind turbine alignment function in Layout.m and a GUI to adjust
settings and visualize output in LayoutTest.m.

Proof of concept.

Tries to align in a streamwise/spanwise grid, even when the given wind farm
won't fit with that orientation.  The location adjustment via Newton iteration
causes this to explode when there's no solution.  A robust implementation
would try to move turbine locations to different grid locations to attempt a
proper fit.

Does not account for terrain, wind turbine height, radar height, or Earth
curvature.
